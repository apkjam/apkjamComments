  normal, but it s not as mundane as what any of us are accustomed to.Palmer is
  eventually busted on the band s last night in New York City.See our review of
  the Tedeschi Trucks Band album Revelator here.I remember how hard we tried to
  find even one minute of video material or interview of some of the great

  obtained the video of the trial so everyone was able to see how I worked and
  what my mannerisms are.
