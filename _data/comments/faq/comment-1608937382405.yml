comment: "The coronavirus pandemic has unnatural universities to lash to haughtiness learning. essay writing service uk law <a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>making a thesis statement</a> best rated essay writing service. \r\nBut what is happening now can be named an special delivery of content to audience members in isolation . Most of colleges  and the professors themselves were not prepared for the teach online. According to a 2019 HSE study, University professors with an academic degree rate their level of proficiency in remote technologies at 3.2 points out of five. One in four persons has never utilized remote video services to participate in webinars or video conferences in the past three years. \r\nBut professors are not required to own online learning technologies. They were simply not ready for this, although education and its advanced methods are the main function of varsities. Try to oblige the surgeon to do their work in self-isolation. Let him explain to the patient via Skype how to remove his appendicitis. It sounds strange. Therefore, the resourcefulness with which professors adapt to the remote format is commendable. \r\n \r\nSome of the time it gets funny. Colleagues from regional academies told that some teachers asked to write summary by hand and send them scans for verification.Today, people communicate remotely in real time thanks to modern digital technologies, students can \"raise their hands\" with a single button, they can write with a finger on a tablet as on a blackboard, and they are told: \"Please write a handwritten lectures and send the scan.\" Or, for example, this case: a physical education teacher asked students to shoot five-minute videos where they make physical exercises. In spite of the fact that remote physical education training can be more originative, for example, you can select of ready-made videos on YouTube, find checklists in the public domain, and teach them to play sports at home, while you can't go outside anywhere. \r\n \r\nUniversity educators are faced with a lack of guidance and problems in dealing with organizational matters. Some of them educate on Skype, some of them -in Zoom, some of them only sends questions to WhatsApp. Some professors record lectures on a webcam and send them to students. The quality of such materials is insufficient, and it is hard to perceive them. At least because the content on YouTube, which students are used to, is shot and edited professionally and the viewer is spoiled by the quality of video materials. \r\nThere are also problems with monitoring attendance. Some professors ask you to put a \" + \" in the chat, others require  you to turn on Webcams and take screenshots of students. Against the background of all the misunderstandings and troubles, one element of academic life remains unchanged - assessment. Students don't study on campus, but they will get grades, even formal ones. \r\n<a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>human trafficking thesis statement</a> \r\nOnline learning  does not have these disadvantages, because it is based on a carefully designed learning process in an electronic information and educational environment. Professors have instructions, manuals, memos,checklists, templates for emails and notifications, and even presentations. Everything is thought out here-from the screen saver before the lesson to the slide with homework."
